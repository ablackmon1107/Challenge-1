# Challenge-1
In this challenge, I hoped to improve the code by cleaning the original and making it more readable. I built this project to improve SEO and accessibility for "people with disabilities and/or socio-economic restrictions". This project really challenged me to read through my code with a fine tooth comb so that I don't miss any mistakes that may have made.
